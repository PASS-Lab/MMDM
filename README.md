# Multiple Model Deterioration Modeling (MMDM)

This repository houses the tools and results from a research project in the Department of Civil Engineering at The University of Texas at El Paso. The project was funded through Rutgers University Center for Advanced Infrastructure and Transportation on Federal University Transportation Center Grant #DTRT13-G-UTC28. 
  
The goal of this research is to establish a robust, flexible framework for integrating data collected from operating structures to provide reliable performance assessments and forecast remaining service life (i.e., descriptive relationships) for structures. We first focus on traditional deterioration modeling using the largest dataset available, the National Bridge Inventory condition ratings.

The notable deliverables from the project are:
+ the NBI query tool
+ A radial geopgraphic search tool
+ A Markov Chain Monte Carlo tool
+ A gradient boosted approach to ANN
+ Numerous standard deterioration models (in Excel) and results - located in the UTC-MM-master folder

We will continue to comment and improve these tools as the project progresses.
